  "Alright, let's go." (naiaPartnered = true) (End)

  "I don't think I need a guide." (Go to 6)
4. "Perhaps not, but the marsh is dangerous for outsiders. If you venture deeper in without guidance from a native, you could fall prey to one of its many hazards. If you insist on going anyway, I cannot let you go alone."

  "Alright, then. Let's go." (naiaPartnered = true) (End)
  "Thanks, but I don't need a guide." (Go to 6)
