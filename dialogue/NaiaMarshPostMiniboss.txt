1. "It worked... that put the wraith right to sleep. I am glad that we were able to spare the creature."
  "If you're glad, I'm glad." (Go to 2)
  "It's actually kind of cute when it's not trying to kill me." (Go to 3)
  "It's clear that your tribe has a deep respect for nature. Is that why you wanted to spare the wraith — to maintain harmony with nature?" (Go to 4)
2. "Thank you. That is very kind of you to say." (End)
3. "Hah, I suppose it is. Even the fiercest creatures may have unexpected soft sides." (End)
4. "That is exactly right. Our relationship with nature is how we of Tenli understand the world and ourselves. Harmony is as fragile as it is precious — I only wish more outsiders understood that." (End)

1. "Why did you do that?! We had a plan!"
  "I changed the plan." (Go to 2)
  "I'm so sorry, Naia. It was right on top of me; I had to do something." (Go to 3)
  "Geez, sorry. I didn't think it was that important to you." (Go to 4)

4. "Well, you were mistaken. Tribe Tenli's mission is to maintain harmony with the marsh, not to destroy it." (naiaFriendship - 1) (End)

1. "That puts an end to the greater wraith, then. It is a shame... I will not enjoy reporting this to the elder."
  "I'm sorry, Naia. I wish you had told me how important this was." (Go to 2)
  "It was only a beast. There's no reason to feel bad." (Go to 3)
2. "Yes, I should have done that. I should have been more insistent. But it is too late now." (End)
3. "No, it was not 'just a beast.' The water wraiths are a part of the marsh, a part of nature; they should be respected, not carelessly killed." (naiaFriendship - 1) (End)
