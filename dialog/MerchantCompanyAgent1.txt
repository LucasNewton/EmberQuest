Some coal would be great, thank you.
Thanks, but I need to keep going.
There you go, spark. Enjoy.
Who are you?
What was that about a village?
Name’s Renzel. I work for the Ignis Company, under the House of Ardor. I’m headed to Tenli Village to negotiate a trade deal with the tribe’s elder.
Can you tell me about Tenli Village?
What do you trade with the natives?
Does the Ignis Company do business with the other houses?
It’s an interesting place. We outsiders are only allowed into the ground-level part of the village, where things are made of stone. Tenli masonry is less than impressive, but to be fair, it’s merely a concession made on behalf of visitors; their real crafts are woodworking and weaving. They make some beautiful works out of wood and vines, and they don’t even burn them thanks to the Verdant Ember’s blessing. But alas, you and I can only look at Tenli’s craft from afar.
The marsh is pretty light in mineral resources, so we trade good quality stone and metal, mostly in exchange for foodstuffs. Dry wood, vine, root, that kind of stuff. Some of the noble houses will pay a pretty penny for tribal art, too, but of course, it has to be well preserved as to avoid burning.
Sometimes, but we mostly trade with other provinces. Why do you ask?
I was just curious.
I was wondering because I might want to join up with your company sometime.
I’m a noble myself, and I’d like to negotiate a deal.
Ah, I see. Good to see a young spark with some volition. Our headquarters are back in Gray Coast, in the Northern Province, so you can inquire there when you have the time. We also have a pretty substantial office in Dewyn, capital of the Plains Province.
That so? What’s your name?
Wixellus Ire.
Ekellus Ire.
Kadis Vim.
Habaldt Ardor.
Wixellus… the exiled Ire kid? Heh, well, you’re either pretty dense or too honest for your own good, telling me that. Guess now I know why you didn’t fit in. Still, I don’t think you’re in any position to be negotiating trade deals.
Ah, well met, then, Mr. Ire. So, what’s your proposition?
Oh, Mr. Vim! I heard about your recent duel — whelp had it coming, I say. Can’t get anywhere in the world if you don’t learn some respect. So, how can I help you?
Nah, I’d know if you were an Ardor boy. Try again.

Good day to you, spark. It’s a long road to Tenli Village. Feel free to pull up a rock and rest a while. I’ve even got some coal to spare if you’re hungry.
