Greetings, friend. I see that you <b>aren't</b> from around these parts. My name is Eresea.
You picked a fine day to stumble out here. A bit wet and sad.
You're looking for trouble, aren't you?
No, I'm on a quest to find the Ember.
No sir, do I look like I am?
No, I'm just a traveller. Are there usually bandits out here?
.....
I think I just found some.
You're looking for the Ember??? What, are you mad? You really ARE looking for trouble.
I'm sorry. I've had enough of you. Go along to your doom, then.
Is it really that dangerous?
Goodbye then.
If you continue, you will be the third flame this month to go out.
I won't help you kill yourself. Leave.
I don't need to see it in you, I know it's in you.
Everyone out here is looking for trouble. No other reason to come here. I've seen it many times.
For all that's good and holy... turn back.
Why's that?
You didn't really answer my question about the bandits.
I can't do that.
Nobody makes it back but the reaper.
His pockets are lined with souls claimed from this place...
I've seen it too much. Leave. Please.
There are a few who make it, yes. Those whose lives aren't claimed, they claim others. Spurred on by the reaper.
Is this not enough to deter you? Won't you leave??
.....
...I see.
Ensure you are right before the religious candle, and begone.
If you are going to ignore me, hear this one thing:
The reaper has already claimed two this month. Continue and you will be the third.
Good luck.
Oh, I can skirmish, my friend.
Shouldn't have messed with me.
